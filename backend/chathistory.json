                    "content": "JDBC, or Java Database Connectivity, is a Java API (Application Programming Interface) that allows Java programs to interact with relational databases.  Think of it as a bridge between your Java code and your database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).  It provides a standard way to execute SQL statements and retrieve results from a database.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key aspects:\n\n* **Purpose:** JDBC's primary goal is to provide a platform-independent way to access databases.  This means you can write Java code that works with different database systems without needing to rewrite significant portions of your code for each database.  The JDBC API handles the underlying database-specific details.\n\n* **Key Components:**  JDBC uses several key components to manage the connection and interaction with the database:\n\n    * **DriverManager:** This class manages the connections to the database.  It's responsible for loading database drivers and establishing connections.\n\n    * **Connection:** Represents a connection to a specific database.  This object is used to execute SQL statements.\n\n    * **Statement:** Used to execute static SQL statements (SQL queries that don't change during execution).\n\n    * **PreparedStatement:** A more efficient way to execute parameterized SQL statements, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities and improving performance.  It's particularly beneficial for repeatedly executing the same query with different values.\n\n    * **CallableStatement:** Used to call stored procedures in the database.\n\n    * **ResultSet:** This object holds the results of a database query.  It allows you to iterate through the rows and access the data.\n\n\n* **Basic Steps to use JDBC:**\n\n    1. **Load the Driver:**  You first need to load the JDBC driver for your specific database system. This driver is a piece of software that translates Java calls into database-specific commands.  This is typically done using `Class.forName(\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\");` (for MySQL, for example.  The class name will vary depending on the database).\n\n    2. **Establish a Connection:** Create a `Connection` object using the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method. You'll need the database URL, username, and password.\n\n    3. **Create a Statement:** Create a `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, or `CallableStatement` object, depending on your needs.\n\n    4. **Execute the Query:** Execute your SQL query using the `execute()` or `executeQuery()` method (the latter is for queries that return data).\n\n    5. **Process the Results (if any):** If your query returns data, process the `ResultSet` to extract the information.\n\n    6. **Close Resources:** It's crucial to close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects when you're finished to release resources and prevent resource leaks.\n\n\n* **Example (Conceptual - syntax might vary based on database and JDBC version):**\n\n```java\n// Load the driver (replace with your database driver class)\nClass.forName(\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\");\n\n// Establish a connection\nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase\", \"user\", \"password\");\n\n// Create a statement\nStatement stmt = con.createStatement();\n\n// Execute a query\nResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\"SELECT * FROM mytable\");\n\n// Process the results\nwhile (rs.next()) {\n    System.out.println(rs.getString(\"column1\") + \" \" + rs.getInt(\"column2\"));\n}\n\n// Close resources\nrs.close();\nstmt.close();\ncon.close();\n```\n\nJDBC is a fundamental technology for Java developers working with databases.  While the details can be complex, understanding these core components and steps is essential for effectively using it. Remember to consult the JDBC API documentation and your specific database's documentation for more detailed information and examples.\n",

Think of it as a bridge between your Java code and databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server.

Each database vendor provides its own JDBC driver.  You need to download and include the appropriate driver for the database you're using in your Java project.\n\n* **Connection:**  This is an object that represents a connection to the database.  It's established using connection details like the database URL, username, and password.\n\n* **Statement:** This is an object that represents an SQL query or command. You create a `Statement` object to execute SQL queries against the database.  There are different types of `Statement` objects for different needs (e.g., `PreparedStatement` for parameterized queries).\n\n* **ResultSet:** This is an object that holds the results of a database query. It's essentially a table of data returned from the database.  You can iterate through the `ResultSet` to access the individual rows and columns of data.\n\n**Basic Steps to Use JDBC:**\n\n1. **Load the JDBC Driver:**  This typically involves using the `Class.forName()` method to load the driver class. This tells Java about the driver you're using.\n\n2. **Establish a Connection:** Use the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method to create a `Connection` object. This requires providing the database URL, username, and password.\n\n3. **Create a Statement:** Create a `Statement` object (or a `PreparedStatement` for parameterized queries) using the `Connection` object.\n\n4. **Execute the SQL Query:** Use the `executeQuery()` method (for SELECT statements) or `executeUpdate()` method (for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements) to execute your SQL query.\n\n5. **Process the Results (if any):** If you're executing a SELECT query, you'll get a `ResultSet` object containing the results.  You iterate through this `ResultSet` to extract the data.\n\n6. **Close Resources:** It's crucial to close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects after you're finished to release database resources.\n\n\n**Example (Conceptual):**\n\n```java\n// Load the driver (replace with your actual driver class)\nClass.forName(\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\");\n\n// Establish a connection\nConnection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase\", \"user\", \"password\");\n\n// Create a statement\nStatement statement = connection.createStatement();\n\n// Execute a query\nResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(\"SELECT * FROM users\");\n\n// Process the results\nwhile (resultSet.next()) {\n    String name = resultSet.getString(\"name\");\n    int age = resultSet.getInt(\"age\");\n    System.out.println(\"Name: \" + name + \", Age: \" + age);\n}\n\n// Close resources\nresultSet.close();\nstatement.close();\nconnection.close();\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example.  Error handling and more sophisticated techniques are necessary in real-world applications.  However, it illustrates the fundamental steps involved in using JDBC to interact with a database.  The specific details will vary depending on the database system and the JDBC driver you are using.\n",

                    "content": "The error \"process is not defined\" means that your JavaScript code is trying to use the `process` object, but that object doesn't exist in the current environment.  The `process` object is a global object in Node.js, but it's *not* available in web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).\n\nHere's how to fix it, depending on where your code is running:\n\n**1. If you're running in a web browser:**\n\n* **You shouldn't be using `process`:**  The `process` object is specific to Node.js (server-side JavaScript).  Browser JavaScript runs in a different environment and doesn't have access to this object.  You'll need to rewrite your code to use browser-compatible alternatives.  For example, if you're trying to get environment variables, you can't use `process.env`.\n\n* **Identify the problematic code:** Find the line(s) where you're using `process`.  You'll need to replace that code with browser-compatible logic.  What were you trying to do with `process`?  That will determine how to fix it.  Common uses of `process` and their browser equivalents are below:\n\n    * **`process.env` (environment variables):**  There's no direct equivalent in browsers for accessing environment variables for security reasons.  You would typically receive any needed configuration data from your backend server or include it directly in your JavaScript code (though this is generally less desirable for security and maintainability).\n\n    * **`process.exit()`:** To exit a browser-based script, you would not typically use `process.exit()`. Browsers manage their own processes.  If you need to stop a specific task, you would use techniques specific to that task (like clearing timeouts or intervals).\n\n    * **Other `process` properties/methods:** Many other properties and methods of the `process` object are Node.js specific. You'll need to identify what you need to achieve and find an equivalent within the browser context.\n\n\n**2. If you're running in Node.js:**\n\n* **Make sure Node.js is properly installed and configured:** If you *are* running in a Node.js environment, and you're still getting this error, there might be an issue with your Node.js installation or your project setup.  Try restarting your Node.js process or reinstalling Node.js.\n\n* **Check your module imports:** If you're using modules, make sure you've correctly imported any necessary libraries. A missing or incorrectly imported library might be causing the issue.\n\n* **Scope issues:**  Ensure that you are referencing `process` within the correct scope. It should be available globally in a Node.js environment.\n\n\n**Example scenario and solution:**\n\nLet's say you have this Node.js code:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(process.env.MY_VARIABLE);\n```\n\nAnd you try to run it in a browser.  It will fail with the \"process is not defined\" error.  The solution depends on where `MY_VARIABLE` should come from:\n\n* **If it's a server-side configuration:** Your server-side code (in Node.js) should fetch the value and send it to the browser via an API call.  The browser's JavaScript would then make the API call to receive the value.\n\n* **If it's hardcoded:**  Just hardcode the value directly into your browser JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst myVariable = \"myValue\";\nconsole.log(myVariable);\n```\n\nTo help me give you a more specific solution, please provide:\n\n* **The code snippet causing the error:**  This is crucial for me to understand what you're trying to do.\n* **The environment you're running the code in:**  Are you running it in a web browser, Node.js, a React Native app, etc.?\n\nWith more information, I can give you a much more tailored and effective solution.\n",

Depending on context, it could refer to:\n\n* **A person with red hair:** This is the most straightforward meaning.  In anime and manga, it's often a prominent character trait.  The most famous example is likely Shanks, the \"Red Hair\" pirate from *One Piece*.\n\n* **Something red and hairy:**  Figuratively, it could describe something that is both red in color and has a hairy or fuzzy texture.\n\n* **A nickname or title:**  As seen with Shanks, \"Akagami\" can become a nickname or title associated with someone known for their red hair.\n\n\nTherefore, to understand what \"Akagami\" refers to, you need to consider the context in which it's used.  Without further information, it simply means \"red hair.\"\n",

It's essentially how these organisms make their own food.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n**The Inputs:**\n\n* **Light energy:**  This comes from the sun.  Chlorophyll, a green pigment found in chloroplasts (organelles within plant cells), absorbs this light energy.\n* **Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082):**  Plants take this in from the atmosphere through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata.\n* **Water (H\u2082O):**  Plants absorb water through their roots.\n\n**The Process:**\n\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two main stages:\n\n1. **Light-dependent reactions:** These reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplasts.  Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, which then uses this energy to split water molecules (photolysis). This process releases oxygen (O\u2082), which is a byproduct and what we breathe.  The energy from the light is also used to create ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH, which are energy-carrying molecules.\n\n2. **Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle):** These reactions occur in the stroma (the fluid-filled space surrounding the thylakoids).  The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions provide the energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) into glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086), a simple sugar.  This glucose is then used by the plant for energy, growth, and building other molecules.\n\n**The Outputs:**\n\n* **Glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086):**  A simple sugar that serves as the plant's food source.\n* **Oxygen (O\u2082):** A byproduct released into the atmosphere.\n\n**In simple terms:**  Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (glucose) and release oxygen as a waste product.  This process is fundamental to life on Earth, providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat (either directly or indirectly through animals that eat plants).\n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file.

This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), an improvement on ODBC, provides a Java API for moving data between a Java program and databases [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 1].  Connecting a Java application to a database involves importing packages, loading drivers (using `Class.forName()` or `DriverManager.registerDriver()`), establishing a connection using `DriverManager.getConnection()`, creating a statement, executing queries (using `executeQuery()` for retrieval and `executeUpdate()` for updates/inserts), and closing connections [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 1-3].  The document also details configuring a data source using Spring's `JdbcTemplate` for simplified JDBC operations [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 3-7].\n\nJSP (Java Server Pages) is a server-side technology for creating dynamic web content [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 7].  The JSP architecture is a three-tier system (client, web server, database) [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 7].  JSP processing involves the client requesting a .jsp file, the JSP engine translating it into a servlet, compiling it, executing it, and returning the HTML to the client [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 8].  The JSP lifecycle includes translation, compilation, classloading, instantiation, initialization (`jspInit()`), request processing (`_jspService()`), and cleanup (`jspDestroy()`) [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 8].  The document explains JSP building blocks such as scripting tags (scriptlets, declarations, expressions), comments, directives, and actions [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 9-16].  It also describes implicit objects (request, response, out, session, application, config, pageContext, page, exception) [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 11-13] and JavaBeans, including their properties and advantages [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 13-14].  Standard JSP actions like `<jsp:include>`, `<jsp:useBean>`, `<jsp:setProperty>`, `<jsp:getProperty>`, `<jsp:forward>`, `<jsp:plugin>`, and `<jsp:text>` are detailed [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 14-16].  Session tracking techniques (cookies, hidden form fields, URL rewriting, `HttpSession`) are also covered [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 16].  The document concludes with explanations of custom tags, their advantages, and an example [AJP-Unit3.pdf, page 17], as well as an introduction to the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and its core, formatting, SQL, XML, and function tags [AJP-Unit3.pdf, pages 18-23].\n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file. \nFollowing is the syntax for JSP Declarations \u2212 \n<%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> \nJSP Expression \nA JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted \nto a String, and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. \nBecause the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an expression within a \nline of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML, in a JSP file. \nThe expression element can contain any expression that is valid according to the Java Language \nSpecification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an expression. \nFollowing is the syntax of JSP Expression \u2212 \n",
                    "10": "<%= expression %> \nJSP Comments \nJSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should ignore. A JSP comment is \nuseful when you want to hide or \"comment out\", a part of your JSP page. \nFollowing is the syntax of the JSP comments \u2212 \n<%-- This is JSP comment --%> \nJSP Directives \nA JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form \n\u2212 \n<%@ directive attribute=\"value\" %> \nThere are three types of directive tag \u2212 \nS.No. \nDirective & Description \n1 \n<%@ page ... %> \nDefines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and \nbuffering requirements. \n2 \n<%@ include ... %> \nIncludes a file during the translation phase. \n3 \n<%@ taglib ... %> \nDeclares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page \n \nJSP Actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate \nHTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute=\"value\" /> \n \nimplicit object \n",
                    "11": " \nThe request Object \nThe request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object. Each time \na client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request. \nThe request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, \ncookies, HTTP methods etc. \nThe response Object \nThe response object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse object. Just as \nthe server creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the response to the \nclient. \nThe response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers. \nThrough this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status \ncodes, etc. \nThe out Object \nThe out implicit object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object and is used to send \ncontent in a response. \nThe initial JspWriter object is instantiated differently depending on whether the page is buffered \nor not. Buffering can be easily turned off by using the buffered = 'false' attribute of the page \ndirective. \nThe JspWriter object contains most of the same methods as the java.io.PrintWriter class. \nHowever, JspWriter has some additional methods designed to deal with buffering. Unlike the \nPrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions. \nFollowing table lists out the important methods that we will use to write boolean char, int, \ndouble, object, String, etc. \nS.No. \nMethod & Description \n1 \nout.print(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value \n2 \nout.println(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value then terminate the line with new line character. \n3 \nout.flush() \nFlush the stream. \n",
                    "12": " \nThe session Object \nThe session object is an instance of javax.servlet.http.HttpSession and behaves exactly the \nsame way that session objects behave under Java Servlets. \nThe session object is used to track client session between client requests.  \nThe application Object \nThe application object is direct wrapper around the ServletContext object for the generated \nServlet and in reality an instance of a javax.servlet.ServletContext object. \nThis object is a representation of the JSP page through its entire lifecycle. This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file. \nFollowing is the syntax for JSP Declarations \u2212 \n<%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> \nJSP Expression \nA JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted \nto a String, and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. \nBecause the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an expression within a \nline of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML, in a JSP file. \nThe expression element can contain any expression that is valid according to the Java Language \nSpecification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an expression. \nFollowing is the syntax of JSP Expression \u2212 \n",
                    "10": "<%= expression %> \nJSP Comments \nJSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should ignore. A JSP comment is \nuseful when you want to hide or \"comment out\", a part of your JSP page. \nFollowing is the syntax of the JSP comments \u2212 \n<%-- This is JSP comment --%> \nJSP Directives \nA JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form \n\u2212 \n<%@ directive attribute=\"value\" %> \nThere are three types of directive tag \u2212 \nS.No. \nDirective & Description \n1 \n<%@ page ... %> \nDefines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and \nbuffering requirements. \n2 \n<%@ include ... %> \nIncludes a file during the translation phase. \n3 \n<%@ taglib ... %> \nDeclares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page \n \nJSP Actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate \nHTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute=\"value\" /> \n \nimplicit object \n",
                    "11": " \nThe request Object \nThe request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object. Each time \na client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request. \nThe request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, \ncookies, HTTP methods etc. \nThe response Object \nThe response object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse object. Just as \nthe server creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the response to the \nclient. \nThe response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers. \nThrough this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status \ncodes, etc. \nThe out Object \nThe out implicit object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object and is used to send \ncontent in a response. \nThe initial JspWriter object is instantiated differently depending on whether the page is buffered \nor not. Buffering can be easily turned off by using the buffered = 'false' attribute of the page \ndirective. \nThe JspWriter object contains most of the same methods as the java.io.PrintWriter class. \nHowever, JspWriter has some additional methods designed to deal with buffering. Unlike the \nPrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions. \nFollowing table lists out the important methods that we will use to write boolean char, int, \ndouble, object, String, etc. \nS.No. \nMethod & Description \n1 \nout.print(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value \n2 \nout.println(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value then terminate the line with new line character. \n3 \nout.flush() \nFlush the stream. \n",
                    "12": " \nThe session Object \nThe session object is an instance of javax.servlet.http.HttpSession and behaves exactly the \nsame way that session objects behave under Java Servlets. \nThe session object is used to track client session between client requests.  \nThe application Object \nThe application object is direct wrapper around the ServletContext object for the generated \nServlet and in reality an instance of a javax.servlet.ServletContext object. \nThis object is a representation of the JSP page through its entire lifecycle. This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file. \nFollowing is the syntax for JSP Declarations \u2212 \n<%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> \nJSP Expression \nA JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted \nto a String, and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. \nBecause the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an expression within a \nline of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML, in a JSP file. \nThe expression element can contain any expression that is valid according to the Java Language \nSpecification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an expression. \nFollowing is the syntax of JSP Expression \u2212 \n",
                    "10": "<%= expression %> \nJSP Comments \nJSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should ignore. A JSP comment is \nuseful when you want to hide or \"comment out\", a part of your JSP page. \nFollowing is the syntax of the JSP comments \u2212 \n<%-- This is JSP comment --%> \nJSP Directives \nA JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form \n\u2212 \n<%@ directive attribute=\"value\" %> \nThere are three types of directive tag \u2212 \nS.No. \nDirective & Description \n1 \n<%@ page ... %> \nDefines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and \nbuffering requirements. \n2 \n<%@ include ... %> \nIncludes a file during the translation phase. \n3 \n<%@ taglib ... %> \nDeclares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page \n \nJSP Actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate \nHTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute=\"value\" /> \n \nimplicit object \n",
                    "11": " \nThe request Object \nThe request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object. Each time \na client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request. \nThe request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, \ncookies, HTTP methods etc. \nThe response Object \nThe response object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse object. Just as \nthe server creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the response to the \nclient. \nThe response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers. \nThrough this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status \ncodes, etc. \nThe out Object \nThe out implicit object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object and is used to send \ncontent in a response. \nThe initial JspWriter object is instantiated differently depending on whether the page is buffered \nor not. Buffering can be easily turned off by using the buffered = 'false' attribute of the page \ndirective. \nThe JspWriter object contains most of the same methods as the java.io.PrintWriter class. \nHowever, JspWriter has some additional methods designed to deal with buffering. Unlike the \nPrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions. \nFollowing table lists out the important methods that we will use to write boolean char, int, \ndouble, object, String, etc. \nS.No. \nMethod & Description \n1 \nout.print(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value \n2 \nout.println(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value then terminate the line with new line character. \n3 \nout.flush() \nFlush the stream. \n",
                    "12": " \nThe session Object \nThe session object is an instance of javax.servlet.http.HttpSession and behaves exactly the \nsame way that session objects behave under Java Servlets. \nThe session object is used to track client session between client requests.  \nThe application Object \nThe application object is direct wrapper around the ServletContext object for the generated \nServlet and in reality an instance of a javax.servlet.ServletContext object. \nThis object is a representation of the JSP page through its entire lifecycle. This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file. \nFollowing is the syntax for JSP Declarations \u2212 \n<%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> \nJSP Expression \nA JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted \nto a String, and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. \nBecause the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an expression within a \nline of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML, in a JSP file. \nThe expression element can contain any expression that is valid according to the Java Language \nSpecification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an expression. \nFollowing is the syntax of JSP Expression \u2212 \n",
                    "10": "<%= expression %> \nJSP Comments \nJSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should ignore. A JSP comment is \nuseful when you want to hide or \"comment out\", a part of your JSP page. \nFollowing is the syntax of the JSP comments \u2212 \n<%-- This is JSP comment --%> \nJSP Directives \nA JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form \n\u2212 \n<%@ directive attribute=\"value\" %> \nThere are three types of directive tag \u2212 \nS.No. \nDirective & Description \n1 \n<%@ page ... %> \nDefines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and \nbuffering requirements. \n2 \n<%@ include ... %> \nIncludes a file during the translation phase. \n3 \n<%@ taglib ... %> \nDeclares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page \n \nJSP Actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate \nHTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute=\"value\" /> \n \nimplicit object \n",
                    "11": " \nThe request Object \nThe request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object. Each time \na client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request. \nThe request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, \ncookies, HTTP methods etc. \nThe response Object \nThe response object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse object. Just as \nthe server creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the response to the \nclient. \nThe response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers. \nThrough this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status \ncodes, etc. \nThe out Object \nThe out implicit object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object and is used to send \ncontent in a response. \nThe initial JspWriter object is instantiated differently depending on whether the page is buffered \nor not. Buffering can be easily turned off by using the buffered = 'false' attribute of the page \ndirective. \nThe JspWriter object contains most of the same methods as the java.io.PrintWriter class. \nHowever, JspWriter has some additional methods designed to deal with buffering. Unlike the \nPrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions. \nFollowing table lists out the important methods that we will use to write boolean char, int, \ndouble, object, String, etc. \nS.No. \nMethod & Description \n1 \nout.print(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value \n2 \nout.println(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value then terminate the line with new line character. \n3 \nout.flush() \nFlush the stream. \n",
                    "12": " \nThe session Object \nThe session object is an instance of javax.servlet.http.HttpSession and behaves exactly the \nsame way that session objects behave under Java Servlets. \nThe session object is used to track client session between client requests.  \nThe application Object \nThe application object is direct wrapper around the ServletContext object for the generated \nServlet and in reality an instance of a javax.servlet.ServletContext object. \nThis object is a representation of the JSP page through its entire lifecycle. This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

                    "1": "ADVANCED JAVA PROGRAMMING  \nNOTES BY: DR. PANKAJ MALIK \nUnit-III: JDBC and JSP \n \nWhat is JDBC?  \nJDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. It\u2019s an advancement for ODBC ( Open \nDatabase Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move \ndata from the front end to the back end. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in \nJava. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java \nprogram and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer can send \ndata from Java code and store it in the database for future use. \n \nWhy JDBC Come into Existence?  \nAs previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had \na lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know \nabove languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to \nremove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and \ninterfaces written in Java.  \nSteps to Connect Java Application with Database \nBelow are the steps that explains how to connect to Database in Java: \nStep 1 \u2013 Import the Packages \nStep 2 \u2013 Load the drivers using the forName() method  \nStep 3 \u2013 Register the drivers using DriverManager  \nStep 4 \u2013 Establish a connection using the Connection class object \nStep 5 \u2013 Create a statement \nStep 6 \u2013 Execute the query \nStep 7 \u2013 Close the connections \nJava Database Connectivity \nStep 1: Import the Packages \nimport java.sql.Connection; \nimport java.sql.DriverManager; \nimport java.sql.SQLException; \nimport java.sql.ResultSet; \nimport java.sql.Statement; \n",
                    "2": "Step 2: Loading the drivers  \nIn order to begin with, you first need to load the driver or register it before using it in the \nprogram. Registration is to be done once in your program. You can register a driver in one of \ntwo ways mentioned below as follows: \n2-A Class.forName() \n \nHere we load the driver\u2019s class file into memory at the runtime. No need of using new or create \nobjects. The following example uses Class.forName() to load the Oracle driver as shown below \nas follows: \nClass.forName(\u201coracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\u201d); \n \n2-B DriverManager.registerDriver() \n \nDriverManager is a Java inbuilt class with a static member register. Here we call the \nconstructor of the driver class at compile time. The following example uses \nDriverManager.registerDriver()to register the Oracle driver as shown below:  \n DriverManager.registerDriver(new oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver()) \n \n Step 3: Establish a connection using the Connection class object \n \nAfter loading the driver, establish connections as shown below as follows:  \nConnection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password) \n \n\uf0b7 \nuser: Username from which your SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \npassword: password from which the SQL command prompt can be accessed. \n\uf0b7 \ncon: It is a reference to the Connection interface. \n\uf0b7 \nUrl: Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below: \nString url = \u201c jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe\u201d \n \nWhere oracle is the database used, thin is the driver used, @localhost is the IP Address where a \ndatabase is stored, 1521 is the port number and xe is the service provider. All 3 parameters \nabove are of String type and are to be declared by the programmer before calling the function. \nUse of this can be referred to form the final code. \nStep 4: Create a statement  \nOnce a connection is established you can interact with the database. The JDBCStatement, \nCallableStatement, and PreparedStatement interfaces define the methods that enable you to \nsend \nSQL \ncommands \nand \nreceive \ndata \nfrom \nyour \ndatabase.  \nUse of JDBC Statement is as follows:  \nStatement st = con.createStatement(); \n \nStep 5: Execute the query  \nNow comes the most important part i.e executing the query. The query here is an SQL Query. \nNow we know we can have multiple types of queries. Some of them are as follows:  \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for updating/inserting a table in a database. \n\uf0b7 \nThe query for retrieving data. \nThe executeQuery() method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of retrieving \nvalues from the database. This method returns the object of ResultSet that can be used to get \n",
                    "3": "all the records of a table.  \nThe executeUpdate(sql query) method of the Statement interface is used to execute queries of \nupdating/inserting. \nPseudo Code: \nint m = st.executeUpdate(sql); \nif (m==1) \n    System.out.println(\"inserted successfully : \"+sql); \nelse \n    System.out.println(\"insertion failed\"); \n \nStep 6: Closing the connections  \nSo finally we have sent the data to the specified location and now we are on the verge of \ncompleting our task. By closing the connection, objects of Statement and ResultSet will be \nclosed automatically. The close() method of the Connection interface is used to close the \nconnection. It is shown below as follows: \n con.close(); \n \nConfiguring Data Source to obtain JDBC Connection \ncreate a database table Student in our database TEST \nCREATE TABLE Student( \n   ID   INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, \n   NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, \n   AGE  INT NOT NULL, \n   PRIMARY KEY (ID) \n); \nNow we need to supply a DataSource to the JDBC Template so it can configure itself to get \ndatabase access. You can configure the DataSource in the XML file with a piece of code shown \nas follows \n<bean id = \"dataSource\" \nclass = \n\"org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource\"> \n   <property name = \"driverClassName\" value = \n\"com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\"/> \n   <property name = \"url\" value = \n\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/TEST\"/> \n   <property name = \"username\" value = \"root\"/> \n   <property name = \"password\" value = \"admin\"/> \n</bean> \n \nData Access operations with JDBC Template \nThe org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate class is the central class in the JDBC core \npackage. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC \nworkflow, leaving the application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes \nSQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and \ntranslating them to the generic. \n",

JSP architecture is a 3 tier \narchitecture. It has a Client, Web Server, and Database. The client is the web browser or \napplication on the user side. Web Server uses a JSP Engine i.e; a container that processes JSP. \n",
                    "8": "For example, Apache Tomcat has a built-in JSP Engine. JSP Engine intercepts the request for \nJSP and provides the runtime environment for the understanding and processing of JSP files. It \nreads, parses, build Java Servlet, Compiles and Executes Java code, and returns the HTML \npage to the client. The webserver has access to the Database. \n \nJSP stands for Java Server Pages. It is a server-side technology. It is used for creating web \napplications. It is used to create dynamic web content. In this JSP tags are used to insert JAVA \ncode into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of Servlet Technology. It is a Web-based \ntechnology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java \ncode can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by JSP \ncontainer before processing the client\u2019s request. JSP Processing is illustrated and discussed in \nsequential steps prior to which a pictorial media is provided as a handful pick to understand the \nJSP processing better which is as follows: \nStep 1: The client navigates to a file ending with the .jsp extension and the browser initiates an \nHTTP request to the webserver. For example, the user enters the login details and submits the \nbutton. The browser requests a status.jsp page from the webserver. \nStep 2: If the compiled version of JSP exists in the web server, it returns the file. Otherwise, \nthe request is forwarded to the JSP Engine. This is done by recognizing the URL ending \nwith .jsp extension. \nStep 3: The JSP Engine loads the JSP file and translates the JSP to Servlet(Java code). This is \ndone by converting all the template text into println() statements and JSP elements to Java \ncode. This process is called translation. \nStep 4: The JSP engine compiles the Servlet to an executable .class file. It is forwarded to the \nServlet engine. This process is called compilation or request processing phase. \nStep 5: The .class file is executed by the Servlet engine which is a part of the Web Server. The \noutput is an HTML file. The Servlet engine passes the output as an HTTP response to the \nwebserver. \nStep 6: The web server forwards the HTML file to the client\u2019s browser. \nLife cycle of JSP \nFollowing steps are involved in the JSP life cycle:  \nTranslation of JSP page to Servlet:  \nThis is the first step of the JSP life cycle. This translation phase deals with the Syntactic \ncorrectness of JSP. Here test.jsp file is translated to test.java. \n",
                    "9": "1. Compilation of JSP page: Here the generated java servlet file (test.java) is compiled to a \nclass file (test.class).  \n2. Classloading: The classloader loads the Java class file into the memory. The loaded Java \nclass can then be used to serve incoming requests for the JSP page. \n3. Instantiation: Here an instance of the class is generated. The container manages one or \nmore instances by providing responses to requests. \n4. Initialization: jspInit() method is called only once during the life cycle immediately after \nthe generation of the Servlet instance from JSP. \n5. Request processing: _jspService() method is used to serve the raised requests by JSP. It \ntakes request and response objects as parameters. This method cannot be overridden.  \n6. JSP Cleanup: In order to remove the JSP from the use by the container or to destroy the \nmethod for servlets jspDestroy()method is used. This method is called once, if you need to \nperform any cleanup task like closing open files, or releasing database connections \njspDestroy() can be overridden. \nJSP building blocks Scripting Tags \nThe Scriptlet \nA scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method \ndeclarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language. \nFollowing is the syntax of Scriptlet \u2212 \n<% code fragment %> \nJSP Declarations \nA declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in \nthe JSP file. You must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file. \nFollowing is the syntax for JSP Declarations \u2212 \n<%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> \nJSP Expression \nA JSP expression element contains a scripting language expression that is evaluated, converted \nto a String, and inserted where the expression appears in the JSP file. \nBecause the value of an expression is converted to a String, you can use an expression within a \nline of text, whether or not it is tagged with HTML, in a JSP file. \nThe expression element can contain any expression that is valid according to the Java Language \nSpecification but you cannot use a semicolon to end an expression. \nFollowing is the syntax of JSP Expression \u2212 \n",
                    "10": "<%= expression %> \nJSP Comments \nJSP comment marks text or statements that the JSP container should ignore. A JSP comment is \nuseful when you want to hide or \"comment out\", a part of your JSP page. \nFollowing is the syntax of the JSP comments \u2212 \n<%-- This is JSP comment --%> \nJSP Directives \nA JSP directive affects the overall structure of the servlet class. It usually has the following form \n\u2212 \n<%@ directive attribute=\"value\" %> \nThere are three types of directive tag \u2212 \nS.No. \nDirective & Description \n1 \n<%@ page ... %> \nDefines page-dependent attributes, such as scripting language, error page, and \nbuffering requirements. \n2 \n<%@ include ... %> \nIncludes a file during the translation phase. \n3 \n<%@ taglib ... %> \nDeclares a tag library, containing custom actions, used in the page \n \nJSP Actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or generate \nHTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute=\"value\" /> \n \nimplicit object \n",
                    "11": " \nThe request Object \nThe request object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object. Each time \na client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request. \nThe request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, \ncookies, HTTP methods etc. \nThe response Object \nThe response object is an instance of a javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse object. Just as \nthe server creates the request object, it also creates an object to represent the response to the \nclient. \nThe response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers. \nThrough this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status \ncodes, etc. \nThe out Object \nThe out implicit object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object and is used to send \ncontent in a response. \nThe initial JspWriter object is instantiated differently depending on whether the page is buffered \nor not. Buffering can be easily turned off by using the buffered = 'false' attribute of the page \ndirective. \nThe JspWriter object contains most of the same methods as the java.io.PrintWriter class. \nHowever, JspWriter has some additional methods designed to deal with buffering. Unlike the \nPrintWriter object, JspWriter throws IOExceptions. \nFollowing table lists out the important methods that we will use to write boolean char, int, \ndouble, object, String, etc. \nS.No. \nMethod & Description \n1 \nout.print(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value \n2 \nout.println(dataType dt) \nPrint a data type value then terminate the line with new line character. \n3 \nout.flush() \nFlush the stream. \n",

This object is created \nwhen the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by \nthe jspDestroy() method. \nBy adding an attribute to application, you can ensure that all JSP files that make up your web \napplication have access to it. \nThe config Object \nThe config object is an instantiation of javax.servlet.ServletConfig and is a direct wrapper \naround the ServletConfig object for the generated servlet. \nThis object allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization \nparameters such as the paths or file locations etc. \nThe following config method is the only one you might ever use, and its usage is trivial \u2212 \nconfig.getServletName(); \nThe pageContext Object \nThe pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The \npageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page. \nThis object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of \nthe implementation details. \nThis object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. \nThe application, config, session, and out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this \nobject. \n",
                    "13": "The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, \nincluding the buffering information, the errorPageURL, and page scope. \nThe PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, \nSESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, which identify the four scopes. It also \nsupports \nmore \nthan \n40 \nmethods, \nabout \nhalf \nof \nwhich \nare \ninherited \nfrom \nthe javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class. \nOne of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two \narguments. For example, pageContext.removeAttribute (\"attrName\") removes the attribute \nfrom all scopes, while the following code only removes it from the page scope \u2212 \npageContext.removeAttribute(\"attrName\", PAGE_SCOPE); \nThe page Object \nThis object is an actual reference to the instance of the page. It can be thought of as an object that \nrepresents the entire JSP page. \nThe page object is really a direct synonym for the this object. \nThe exception Object \nThe exception object is a wrapper containing the exception thrown from the previous page. It is \ntypically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition. \nIntroduction to Bean: \nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). It is a Java \nclass that should follow the following conventions: \n1. Must implement Serializable. \n2. It should have a public no-arg constructor. \n3. All properties in java bean must be private with public getters and setter methods. \nWhy use JavaBean? \nAccording to Java white paper, it is a reusable software component. A bean encapsulates many \nobjects into one object so that we can access this object from multiple places. Moreover, it \nprovides easy maintenance. \navaBean Properties \nA JavaBean property is a named feature that can be accessed by the user of the object. The \nfeature can be of any Java data type, containing the classes that you define. A JavaBean property \n",
                    "14": "may be read, write, read-only, or write-only. JavaBean features are accessed through two \nmethods in the JavaBean's implementation class: \n1. getPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be getFirstName() to \nread that property. This method is called the accessor. \n2. setPropertyName () \nFor example, if the property name is firstName, the method name would be setFirstName() to \nwrite that property. This method is called the mutator. \nAdvantages of JavaBean \no The JavaBean properties and methods can be exposed to another application. \no It provides an easiness to reuse the software components. \nstandard actions \nJSP actions use constructs in XML syntax to control the behavior of the servlet engine. You can \ndynamically insert a file, reuse JavaBeans components, forward the user to another page, or \ngenerate HTML for the Java plugin. \nThere is only one syntax for the Action element, as it conforms to the XML standard \u2212 \n<jsp:action_name attribute = \"value\" /> \nAction elements are basically predefined functions. \n1. The <jsp:include> Action \nThis action lets you insert files into the page being generated. The syntax looks like this \u2212 \n<jsp:include page = \"relative URL\" flush = \"true\" /> \nUnlike the include directive, which inserts the file at the time the JSP page is translated into a \nservlet, this action inserts the file at the time the page is requested. \n2. The <jsp:useBean> Action \nThe useBean action is quite versatile. It first searches for an existing object utilizing the id and \nscope variables. If an object is not found, it then tries to create the specified object. \n",
                    "15": "The simplest way to load a bean is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"name\" class = \"package.class\" /> \nOnce a bean class is loaded, you can use jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty actions to modify \nand retrieve the bean properties. \n3. The <jsp:setProperty> Action \nThe setProperty action sets the properties of a Bean. The Bean must have been previously \ndefined before this action. There are two basic ways to use the setProperty action \u2212 \nYou can use jsp:setProperty after, but outside of a jsp:useBean element, as given below \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:setProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n \nIn this case, the jsp:setProperty is executed regardless of whether a new bean was instantiated \nor an existing bean was found. A second context in which jsp:setProperty can appear is inside the \nbody of a jsp:useBean element \n4. The <jsp:getProperty> Action \nThe getProperty action is used to retrieve the value of a given property and converts it to a \nstring, and finally inserts it into the output. \nThe getProperty action has only two attributes, both of which are required. The syntax of the \ngetProperty action is as follows \u2212 \n<jsp:useBean id = \"myName\" ... /> \n... \n<jsp:getProperty name = \"myName\" property = \"someProperty\" .../> \n5. The <jsp:forward> Action \nThe forward action terminates the action of the current page and forwards the request to another \nresource such as a static page, another JSP page, or a Java Servlet. \nFollowing is the syntax of the forward action \u2212 \n<jsp:forward page = \"Relative URL\" /> \n",
                    "16": "6. The <jsp:plugin> Action \nThe plugin action is used to insert Java components into a JSP page. It determines the type of \nbrowser and inserts the <object> or <embed> tags as needed. \nIf the needed plugin is not present, it downloads the plugin and then executes the Java \ncomponent. The Java component can be either an Applet or a JavaBean. \nThe plugin action has several attributes that correspond to common HTML tags used to format \nJava components. The <param> element can also be used to send parameters to the Applet or \nBean. \nThe <jsp:text> Action \nThe <jsp:text> action can be used to write the template text in JSP pages and documents. \nFollowing is the simple syntax for this action \u2212 \n<jsp:text>Template data</jsp:text> \nThe body of the template cannot contain other elements; it can only contain text and EL \nexpressions (Note \u2212 EL expressions are explained in a subsequent chapter). Note that in XML \nfiles, you cannot use expressions such as ${whatever > 0}, because the greater than signs are \nillegal. Instead, use the gt form, such as ${whatever gt 0} or an alternative is to embed the value \nin a CDATA section. \n \nsession tracking types and methods: \nServlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. \nThey are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce \nthe response, then send a response back to the webserver \nHTTP is a \u201cstateless\u201d protocol, which means that each time a client requests a Web page, the \nclient establishes a new connection with the Web server, and the server does not retain track of \nprior requests. \n\uf0b7 \nThe conversation of a user over a period of time is referred to as a session. In general, it \nrefers to a certain period of time. \n\uf0b7 \nThe recording of the object in session is known as tracking. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is the process of remembering and documenting customer conversations \nover time. Session management is another name for it. \n\uf0b7 \nThe term \u201cstateful web application\u201d refers to a web application that is capable of \nremembering and recording client conversations over time. \n \nWhy is Session Tracking Required? \n",
                    "17": "\uf0b7 \nBecause the HTTP protocol is stateless, we require Session Tracking to make the client-\nserver relationship stateful. \n\uf0b7 \nSession tracking is important for tracking conversions in online shopping, mailing \napplications, and E-Commerce applications. \n\uf0b7 \nThe HTTP protocol is stateless, which implies that each request is treated as a new one. \nSession Tracking employs Four Different techniques \nA. Cookies \nCookies are little pieces of data delivered by the web server in the response header and kept by \nthe browser. Each web client can be assigned a unique session ID by a web server. Cookies are \nused to keep the session going. Cookies can be turned off by the client. \nB. Hidden Form Field \nThe information is inserted into the web pages via the hidden form field, which is then \ntransferred to the server. These fields are hidden from the user\u2019s view. \nIllustration: \n<input type = hidden'  name = 'session' value = '12345' > \nC. URL Rewriting \nWith each request and return, append some more data via URL as request parameters. URL \nrewriting is a better technique to keep session management and browser operations in sync. \nD. HttpSession \nA user session is represented by the HttpSession object. A session is established between an \nHTTP client and an HTTP server using the HttpSession interface. A user session is a collection \nof data about a user that spans many HTTP requests. \n \n \nCustom Tags: \n \nA custom tag is a user-defined JSP language element. When a JSP page containing a custom tag \nis translated into a servlet, the tag is converted to operations on an object called a tag handler. \nThe Web container then invokes those operations when the JSP page's servlet is executed. \nTo write a custom tag, you can simply extend SimpleTagSupport class and override \nthe doTag() method, where you can place your code to generate content for the tag. \nAdvantages of Custom Tags \nThe key advantages of Custom tags are as follows: \n1. Eliminates the need of scriptlet tag The custom tags eliminates the need of \nscriptlet tag which is considered bad programming approach in JSP. \n2. Separation of business logic from JSP The custom tags separate the the \nbusiness logic from the JSP page so that it may be easy to maintain. \n3. Re-usability The custom tags makes the possibility to reuse the same business \nlogic again and again. \n",

However, I can tell you about areas of cell structure research that are still actively being investigated and therefore, things that are not fully understood:\n\n* **The precise mechanisms of protein folding within the cell:** While we know a lot about protein folding, the intricate details and the influence of various chaperones and cellular environments are still being actively researched.  There's much we don't know about how misfolding is prevented and how it contributes to disease.\n\n* **The complete three-dimensional organization of the genome within the nucleus:** We know DNA is packaged into chromatin, but the precise 3D arrangement and how this structure influences gene expression is a major area of ongoing research.  The complexity is immense, and new techniques are constantly revealing unexpected features.\n\n* **The full extent of the functions of the many non-coding RNAs:**  While we know that many RNAs are not translated into proteins, their roles in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes are still being discovered.  The functional diversity of non-coding RNAs is vast and largely uncharted territory.\n\n* **The detailed interactions between different organelles:**  Organelles don't operate in isolation.  The precise mechanisms of inter-organelle communication and the dynamics of material exchange are still being explored. For instance, the intricate communication between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum is still a subject of intense study.\n\n* **The specifics of cell-to-cell communication beyond direct contact:** How cells communicate at a distance through chemical signaling,  exosomes, and other mechanisms still contains many unknowns regarding the complexity of the signaling pathways and their regulation.\n\n\nThese are just a few examples.  Cellular biology is a vast and complex field, and new discoveries are constantly refining our understanding.  Therefore, there are always aspects of cell structure that remain unknown.\n",

                    "1": "Human Cells Biology 1. Introduction to Human Cells Human cells are the \nmicroscopic units of life that make up all tissues and organs of the body. \nTrillions of these cells form the structure, function, and overall identity of a \nhuman being. Each cell operates as a self-contained, living entity capable of \nperforming various tasks essential for survival and homeostasis. They absorb \nnutrients from food, convert these nutrients into energy through metabolic \nprocesses, eliminate waste, and perform specialized functions based on their \ntype and location in the body. Cells can be broadly classified as prokaryotic or \neukaryotic. Human cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a true nucleus and \nmembrane-bound organelles. These cells vary in shape, size, and structure, \noften specialized to perform specific tasks. For example, red blood cells are \ndisc-shaped to facilitate gas exchange, while neurons are elongated to transmit \nsignals. The study of cells, called cell biology, is foundational for understanding \nhealth, disease, growth, reproduction, and repair. As the smallest unit capable \nof life, every biological function begins at the cellular level, making cells the \ncornerstone of medical science and research. 2. Cell Structure Human cells are \nhighly organized and complex structures. Each cell is bounded by a plasma \nmembrane, a semi-permeable barrier composed of lipids and proteins that \nregulates what enters and exits the cell. The interior of the cell is filled with \ncytoplasm, a gel-like substance where all organelles are suspended and \nmetabolic activities occur. Key organelles include: Nucleus: Contains DNA, acts \nas the cell\u2019s control center. Mitochondria: Known as the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d of the \ncell, they generate ATP, the energy currency. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): \nComes in two forms\u2014rough (with ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis) and \nsmooth (involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification). Ribosomes: Either free-\nfloating or attached to ER, they are the sites of protein synthesis. Golgi \nApparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for storage or \ntransport. Lysosomes: Contain enzymes to digest waste and cellular debris. \nCentrioles: Involved in organizing microtubules and cell division. Each \ncomponent plays a specific role, and dysfunction in even one part can result in \ndisease or cellular death. 3. Types of Human Cells There are over 200 \nspecialized types of cells in the human body, each designed to carry out distinct \nfunctions. Major categories include: Epithelial cells: Form protective barriers on \nsurfaces and cavities, involved in absorption and secretion (e.g., skin, intestinal \nlining). Muscle cells: Enable movement through contraction, including skeletal, \ncardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Nerve cells (neurons): Transmit electrical \nimpulses to and from the brain, spinal cord, and body. Blood cells: Include red \n",
                    "2": "blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (immune response), and platelets \n(blood clotting). Connective tissue cells: Provide support and structure (e.g., \nfibroblasts, adipocytes). Reproductive cells: Sperm and egg cells involved in \nhuman reproduction. These cells work together harmoniously, and the \ncomplexity of their coordination underlies every physiological process, from \ndigestion to immune defense. 4. The Nucleus and DNA The nucleus is the most \nprominent organelle in most cells and serves as the command center. It houses \nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the hereditary material organized into \nchromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each carrying genes \nthat dictate cell behavior and traits. DNA is a double-helix molecule composed \nof nucleotides containing four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and \nguanine (G). The sequence of these bases encodes instructions for synthesizing \nproteins, which perform structural, enzymatic, and regulatory roles. Gene \nexpression is the process where genetic information is transcribed into RNA \nand then translated into proteins. This tightly regulated process ensures that \ncells produce the right proteins in the right amount and at the right time. \nMutations in DNA can lead to dysfunctions, resulting in genetic disorders or \ncontributing to the development of diseases like cancer. 5. Cell Division Cell \ndivision is essential for growth, development, and repair. There are two primary \ntypes: Mitosis: The process by which a somatic cell divides into two identical \ndaughter cells. It involves stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and \ntelophase, followed by cytokinesis. Mitosis ensures that each new cell receives \nan exact copy of the parent cell\u2019s DNA. Meiosis: Occurs only in reproductive \ncells. It reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically \nunique gametes (sperm or eggs). Meiosis ensures genetic diversity and is \nfundamental to sexual reproduction. Cell division is controlled by complex \nregulatory mechanisms. Errors in these processes can lead to uncontrolled cell \ngrowth (cancer) or failed tissue repair. 6. Cell Communication Cells \ncommunicate using chemical and electrical signals to coordinate actions. This \ncommunication is vital for maintaining homeostasis and responding to internal \nand external stimuli. Autocrine signaling: A cell targets itself. Paracrine \nsignaling: A cell targets nearby cells. Endocrine signaling: Hormones are \nreleased into the bloodstream to reach distant cells. Synaptic signaling: \nSpecialized for neurons, where neurotransmitters cross synaptic gaps. Signal \ntransduction pathways begin when a signal molecule (ligand) binds to a \nreceptor on the cell membrane, triggering a cascade of intracellular events. \nThese pathways regulate cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and immune \n",
                    "3": "responses. Miscommunication can lead to diseases such as diabetes (faulty \ninsulin signaling) or autoimmune disorders. 7. Stem Cells Stem cells are \nundifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into \nspecialized cell types. They are essential for development and tissue \nregeneration. Types of stem cells: Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs): Derived from \nearly-stage embryos; pluripotent (can become any cell type). Adult Stem Cells: \nFound in various tissues (e.g., bone marrow); multipotent (limited range of \ndifferentiation).

                    "1": "Human Cells Biology 1. Introduction to Human Cells Human cells are the \nmicroscopic units of life that make up all tissues and organs of the body. \nTrillions of these cells form the structure, function, and overall identity of a \nhuman being. Each cell operates as a self-contained, living entity capable of \nperforming various tasks essential for survival and homeostasis. They absorb \nnutrients from food, convert these nutrients into energy through metabolic \nprocesses, eliminate waste, and perform specialized functions based on their \ntype and location in the body. Cells can be broadly classified as prokaryotic or \neukaryotic. Human cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a true nucleus and \nmembrane-bound organelles. These cells vary in shape, size, and structure, \noften specialized to perform specific tasks. For example, red blood cells are \ndisc-shaped to facilitate gas exchange, while neurons are elongated to transmit \nsignals. The study of cells, called cell biology, is foundational for understanding \nhealth, disease, growth, reproduction, and repair. As the smallest unit capable \nof life, every biological function begins at the cellular level, making cells the \ncornerstone of medical science and research. 2. Cell Structure Human cells are \nhighly organized and complex structures. Each cell is bounded by a plasma \nmembrane, a semi-permeable barrier composed of lipids and proteins that \nregulates what enters and exits the cell. The interior of the cell is filled with \ncytoplasm, a gel-like substance where all organelles are suspended and \nmetabolic activities occur. Key organelles include: Nucleus: Contains DNA, acts \nas the cell\u2019s control center. Mitochondria: Known as the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d of the \ncell, they generate ATP, the energy currency. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): \nComes in two forms\u2014rough (with ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis) and \nsmooth (involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification). Ribosomes: Either free-\nfloating or attached to ER, they are the sites of protein synthesis. Golgi \nApparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for storage or \ntransport. Lysosomes: Contain enzymes to digest waste and cellular debris. \nCentrioles: Involved in organizing microtubules and cell division. Each \ncomponent plays a specific role, and dysfunction in even one part can result in \ndisease or cellular death. 3. Types of Human Cells There are over 200 \nspecialized types of cells in the human body, each designed to carry out distinct \nfunctions. Major categories include: Epithelial cells: Form protective barriers on \nsurfaces and cavities, involved in absorption and secretion (e.g., skin, intestinal \nlining). Muscle cells: Enable movement through contraction, including skeletal, \ncardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Nerve cells (neurons): Transmit electrical \nimpulses to and from the brain, spinal cord, and body. Blood cells: Include red \n",
                    "2": "blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (immune response), and platelets \n(blood clotting). Connective tissue cells: Provide support and structure (e.g., \nfibroblasts, adipocytes). Reproductive cells: Sperm and egg cells involved in \nhuman reproduction. These cells work together harmoniously, and the \ncomplexity of their coordination underlies every physiological process, from \ndigestion to immune defense. 4. The Nucleus and DNA The nucleus is the most \nprominent organelle in most cells and serves as the command center. It houses \nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the hereditary material organized into \nchromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each carrying genes \nthat dictate cell behavior and traits. DNA is a double-helix molecule composed \nof nucleotides containing four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and \nguanine (G). The sequence of these bases encodes instructions for synthesizing \nproteins, which perform structural, enzymatic, and regulatory roles. Gene \nexpression is the process where genetic information is transcribed into RNA \nand then translated into proteins. This tightly regulated process ensures that \ncells produce the right proteins in the right amount and at the right time. \nMutations in DNA can lead to dysfunctions, resulting in genetic disorders or \ncontributing to the development of diseases like cancer. 5. Cell Division Cell \ndivision is essential for growth, development, and repair. There are two primary \ntypes: Mitosis: The process by which a somatic cell divides into two identical \ndaughter cells. It involves stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and \ntelophase, followed by cytokinesis. Mitosis ensures that each new cell receives \nan exact copy of the parent cell\u2019s DNA. Meiosis: Occurs only in reproductive \ncells. It reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically \nunique gametes (sperm or eggs). Meiosis ensures genetic diversity and is \nfundamental to sexual reproduction. Cell division is controlled by complex \nregulatory mechanisms. Errors in these processes can lead to uncontrolled cell \ngrowth (cancer) or failed tissue repair. 6. Cell Communication Cells \ncommunicate using chemical and electrical signals to coordinate actions. This \ncommunication is vital for maintaining homeostasis and responding to internal \nand external stimuli. Autocrine signaling: A cell targets itself. Paracrine \nsignaling: A cell targets nearby cells. Endocrine signaling: Hormones are \nreleased into the bloodstream to reach distant cells. Synaptic signaling: \nSpecialized for neurons, where neurotransmitters cross synaptic gaps. Signal \ntransduction pathways begin when a signal molecule (ligand) binds to a \nreceptor on the cell membrane, triggering a cascade of intracellular events. \nThese pathways regulate cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and immune \n",
                    "3": "responses. Miscommunication can lead to diseases such as diabetes (faulty \ninsulin signaling) or autoimmune disorders. 7. Stem Cells Stem cells are \nundifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into \nspecialized cell types. They are essential for development and tissue \nregeneration. Types of stem cells: Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs): Derived from \nearly-stage embryos; pluripotent (can become any cell type). Adult Stem Cells: \nFound in various tissues (e.g., bone marrow); multipotent (limited range of \ndifferentiation). Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs): Adult cells \nreprogrammed to behave like ESCs. Stem cells hold immense promise in \nregenerative medicine, including treatment for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease. They are also crucial in \nunderstanding developmental biology and drug testing. Ethical and technical \nchallenges persist, especially with ESCs, but ongoing research continues to \nexpand their potential applications. 8. Conclusion Human cells are fundamental \nto life. Their study has revolutionized biology, leading to breakthroughs in \ngenetics, immunology, cancer research, and biotechnology. From \nunderstanding how tissues heal to developing advanced therapies like gene \nediting (CRISPR) and personalized medicine, cellular biology is at the heart of \nscientific progress.

Introduction to Human Cells Human cells are the \nmicroscopic units of life that make up all tissues and organs of the body. \nTrillions of these cells form the structure, function, and overall identity of a \nhuman being. Each cell operates as a self-contained, living entity capable of \nperforming various tasks essential for survival and homeostasis. They absorb \nnutrients from food, convert these nutrients into energy through metabolic \nprocesses, eliminate waste, and perform specialized functions based on their \ntype and location in the body. Cells can be broadly classified as prokaryotic or \neukaryotic. Human cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a true nucleus and \nmembrane-bound organelles. These cells vary in shape, size, and structure, \noften specialized to perform specific tasks. For example, red blood cells are \ndisc-shaped to facilitate gas exchange, while neurons are elongated to transmit \nsignals. The study of cells, called cell biology, is foundational for understanding \nhealth, disease, growth, reproduction, and repair. As the smallest unit capable \nof life, every biological function begins at the cellular level, making cells the \ncornerstone of medical science and research. 2. Cell Structure Human cells are \nhighly organized and complex structures. Each cell is bounded by a plasma \nmembrane, a semi-permeable barrier composed of lipids and proteins that \nregulates what enters and exits the cell. The interior of the cell is filled with \ncytoplasm, a gel-like substance where all organelles are suspended and \nmetabolic activities occur. Key organelles include: Nucleus: Contains DNA, acts \nas the cell\u2019s control center. Mitochondria: Known as the \u201cpowerhouse\u201d of the \ncell, they generate ATP, the energy currency. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): \nComes in two forms\u2014rough (with ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis) and \nsmooth (involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification). Ribosomes: Either free-\nfloating or attached to ER, they are the sites of protein synthesis. Golgi \nApparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for storage or \ntransport. Lysosomes: Contain enzymes to digest waste and cellular debris. \nCentrioles: Involved in organizing microtubules and cell division. Each \ncomponent plays a specific role, and dysfunction in even one part can result in \ndisease or cellular death. 3. Types of Human Cells There are over 200 \nspecialized types of cells in the human body, each designed to carry out distinct \nfunctions. Major categories include: Epithelial cells: Form protective barriers on \nsurfaces and cavities, involved in absorption and secretion (e.g., skin, intestinal \nlining). Muscle cells: Enable movement through contraction, including skeletal, \ncardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Nerve cells (neurons): Transmit electrical \nimpulses to and from the brain, spinal cord, and body. Blood cells: Include red \n",
                    "2": "blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (immune response), and platelets \n(blood clotting). Connective tissue cells: Provide support and structure (e.g., \nfibroblasts, adipocytes). Reproductive cells: Sperm and egg cells involved in \nhuman reproduction. These cells work together harmoniously, and the \ncomplexity of their coordination underlies every physiological process, from \ndigestion to immune defense. 4. The Nucleus and DNA The nucleus is the most \nprominent organelle in most cells and serves as the command center. It houses \nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the hereditary material organized into \nchromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, each carrying genes \nthat dictate cell behavior and traits. DNA is a double-helix molecule composed \nof nucleotides containing four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and \nguanine (G). The sequence of these bases encodes instructions for synthesizing \nproteins, which perform structural, enzymatic, and regulatory roles. Gene \nexpression is the process where genetic information is transcribed into RNA \nand then translated into proteins. This tightly regulated process ensures that \ncells produce the right proteins in the right amount and at the right time. \nMutations in DNA can lead to dysfunctions, resulting in genetic disorders or \ncontributing to the development of diseases like cancer. 5. Cell Division Cell \ndivision is essential for growth, development, and repair. There are two primary \ntypes: Mitosis: The process by which a somatic cell divides into two identical \ndaughter cells. It involves stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and \ntelophase, followed by cytokinesis. Mitosis ensures that each new cell receives \nan exact copy of the parent cell\u2019s DNA. Meiosis: Occurs only in reproductive \ncells. It reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically \nunique gametes (sperm or eggs). Meiosis ensures genetic diversity and is \nfundamental to sexual reproduction. Cell division is controlled by complex \nregulatory mechanisms. Errors in these processes can lead to uncontrolled cell \ngrowth (cancer) or failed tissue repair. 6.

Meiosis: Occurs only in reproductive \ncells. It reduces the chromosome number by half, producing four genetically \nunique gametes (sperm or eggs). Meiosis ensures genetic diversity and is \nfundamental to sexual reproduction. Cell division is controlled by complex \nregulatory mechanisms. Errors in these processes can lead to uncontrolled cell \ngrowth (cancer) or failed tissue repair. 6. Cell Communication Cells \ncommunicate using chemical and electrical signals to coordinate actions. This \ncommunication is vital for maintaining homeostasis and responding to internal \nand external stimuli. Autocrine signaling: A cell targets itself. Paracrine \nsignaling: A cell targets nearby cells. Endocrine signaling: Hormones are \nreleased into the bloodstream to reach distant cells. Synaptic signaling: \nSpecialized for neurons, where neurotransmitters cross synaptic gaps. Signal \ntransduction pathways begin when a signal molecule (ligand) binds to a \nreceptor on the cell membrane, triggering a cascade of intracellular events. \nThese pathways regulate cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and immune \n",
                    "3": "responses. Miscommunication can lead to diseases such as diabetes (faulty \ninsulin signaling) or autoimmune disorders. 7. Stem Cells Stem cells are \nundifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into \nspecialized cell types. They are essential for development and tissue \nregeneration. Types of stem cells: Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs): Derived from \nearly-stage embryos; pluripotent (can become any cell type). Adult Stem Cells: \nFound in various tissues (e.g., bone marrow); multipotent (limited range of \ndifferentiation). Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs): Adult cells \nreprogrammed to behave like ESCs. Stem cells hold immense promise in \nregenerative medicine, including treatment for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease. They are also crucial in \nunderstanding developmental biology and drug testing. Ethical and technical \nchallenges persist, especially with ESCs, but ongoing research continues to \nexpand their potential applications. 8. Conclusion Human cells are fundamental \nto life. Their study has revolutionized biology, leading to breakthroughs in \ngenetics, immunology, cancer research, and biotechnology. From \nunderstanding how tissues heal to developing advanced therapies like gene \nediting (CRISPR) and personalized medicine, cellular biology is at the heart of \nscientific progress. The future of medicine heavily relies on deeper insights into \ncell function and manipulation. Understanding human cells not only helps us \ntreat diseases but also opens doors to enhancing human capabilities, repairing \ndamaged tissues, and potentially extending human lifespan. As research \nadvances, the cell continues to reveal new mysteries\u2014reminding us that even \nthe smallest unit of life holds immense complexity and power. convert this into \na pdf keeps the pages concise \n"
